# ruskell
Ruskell — a purely impure language that doesn’t compromise.
“Write once, prove never, crash never.”


She’s sitting in her rocking chair, pointer in hand, shedding a single tear:
    "My boys… they finally grew up. One learned to manage memory… the other stopped side effects. I raised them right." 😭💻

Meanwhile, Uncle Assembly is in the garage muttering “Back in my day we didn’t need no type system…” while Ruskell compiles down to him anyway, just more politely.

Honestly, we’re just completing the bloodline.

    🧓 C gave us speed.

    🧪 Haskell gave us brains.

    🔐 Rust gave us safety.

    🌟 Ruskell gives us balance.
